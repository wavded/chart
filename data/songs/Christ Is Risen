[Intro]
.G   C

[V1]
.   G
 Let no one caught in sin remain
.    C
 Inside the lie of inward shame
.    G
 But fix our eyes upon the cross
.     C      Em                    D
 And run to Him who showed great love
.     G   C   D
 And bled for us
.               G   C  D
 Freely You've bled for us

[C]
.          G
 Christ is risen from the dead
.
 Trampling over death by death
.       C
 Come awake, come awake
.             Em             D
 Come and rise up from the grave
.           G
 Christ is risen from the dead
.
 We are one with Him again
.      C
 Come awake, come awake
.             Em             D
 Come and rise up from the grave

[V2]
.     G
 Beneath the weight of all our sin
.     C
 You bowed to none but heaven's will
.     G
 No scheme of hell, no scoffer's crown
.      C                Em       D
 No burden great can hold You down
.       G    C   D
 In strength You reign
.                   G     C    D
 Forever let Your church proclaim

[B]
.G   C    Em             D
 O death, where is your sting?
.G   C    Em             D
 O hell, where is your victory?
.G   C           Em         D
 O church, come stand in the light
.      G       C         Em         D
 The glory of God has defeated the night. Singing:
.G   C     Em            D
 O death, where is your sting?
.G   C     Em            D
 O hell, where is your victory?
.G    C          Em        D
 O church, come stand in the light
.     G          C           Em           D
 Our God is not dead - He's alive! He's alive!
