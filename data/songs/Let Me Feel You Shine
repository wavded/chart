.A             Bm7       Dsus2
 This place is trying to break my belief
.    A           Bm7         Dsus2
 But my faith is bigger than all I can see
.            A   Bm7     Dsus2
 And what I ne - ed is redemption
.            A   Bm7       Dsus2
 And what I ne - ed is for You to put me back on my feet

[P]
.     A  Bm7  Dsus2      A  Bm7  D
 Wo-o-oah           Wo-o-oah

[V2]
 I swear I’m trying to give everything
 But I feel I’m falling, O make me believe
 What I ne - ed is resurrection
 What I ne - ed is for You to put me back on my feet

.                    A             Bm7      Dsus2
 If I could feel You shine Your perpetual light
.                   A            Bm7    Dsus2
 Then maybe I could crawl out of this tonight
.                    A         Bm7             Dsus2
 If I could feel You shine, O, let me feel You shine
.                 A        Bm7           Dsus2
 So beautiful and warm, so beautiful and bright
.                   A       Bm7     Dsus2
 Like a sun coming out of a raining sky
.                   A
 O, let me feel You shine
.   Bm7             Dsus2
 O, let me feel You shine

[V3]
 I lift a knife to the thing I love most
 Praying You come so I can have both
 What I need is You to touch me
 What I need is for You to be the thing that I need

 To come rescue me
