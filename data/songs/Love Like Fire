.E C#m B A E

[V1]
.     E
 I am desperate for Your touch
.                            C#m
 A glimpse of heaven for the glory of Your Son
.                    B
 In a moment You can turn a life around
.   A                   E
 Forever to be found in You

[V2]
.     E
 I am reaching out to find
 There's nothing greater than
.     C#m
 Your love that holds my life
 Your grace and mercy that have
.B
 saved me by Your blood
.    A                       E
 And swept away my shame, oh Lord

[P]
.                    C#m
 Your Love is like a fire
.     A                 E
 that burns for all to see
.B           C#m     A               E
   My only desire to worship at Your feet
.            B               E
 So let this fire consume my life

[C1]
.         E
 Let Your love take me deeper
.B                             C#m
   Draw me closer to where You are
.      A               E
 All I want is more of You

[V3]
.           E
 And I'm surrendered to Your love
.                       C#m
 Forever humbled by the message of the cross
 I stand abandoned in
.      B
 Your presence and embrace
.     A                    E
 I'll never be the same oh God

[P]

[C2]
.         E
 Let Your love take me deeper
.B                             C#m
   Draw me closer to where You are
.      A               E
 All I want is more of You
.         E
 When You call I will follow
.B                          C#m
   At the cross I surrender all
.      A           E
 Jesus I belong to you
