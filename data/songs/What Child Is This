[V1]
.     Am       C         G       Em
 What Child is this who, laid to rest
.   Am     F      E
 On Mary's lap is sleeping?
.     Am     C          G       Em
 Whom Angels greet with anthems sweet,
.      Am        Em        Am
 While shepherds watch are keeping?

 This, this is Christ the King,
.     Am        F         E
 Whom shepherds guard and Angels sing;
.C                G         Em
 Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,
.    Am        E      Am
 The Babe, the Son of Mary.

[V2]
.    Am      C       G    Em
 Why lies He in such mean estate,
.      Am     F         E
 Where ox and mare are feeding?
.     Am          C         G       Em
 Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
.    Am     Em      Am
 The silent Word is pleading.

.   Am        C        G        Em
 So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,
.     Am       F       E
 Come peasant, king to own Him;
.    Am      C     G         Em
 The King of kings salvation brings,
.    Am     Em     Am
 Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
