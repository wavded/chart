[V1]
.     A            F#m
 When peace like a river
.  D  E       A
 Attendeth my way
.     F#m          B           E
 When sorrows like sea billows roll
.    A       D
 Whatever my lot
.         B            E
 Thou hast taught me to say
.      A
 It is well
.      D    E       A
 It is well with my soul

[V2]
 My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought
 My sin, not in part but the whole
 Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

[V2]
 But Lord itâ€™s for Thee, for Thy coming we wait
 The sky not the grave is our goal
 Oh trump of the angel!  Oh voice of the Lord!
 Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!

[C]
.      E            A
 It is well with my soul
.      D
 It is well
.      F#m  E       A
 It is well with my soul

[B]
.            A
 You are the Rock, on which I stand
.        F#m         E
 By Your grace it is well
.           A
 My hope is sure, in Christ my savior
.      F#m  E       A
 It is well with my soul
