.C
 He is jealous for me
.Am7
 Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree
.G                                          Fmaj7
 Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy
.     C
 When all of a sudden,
.                      Am7
 I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
.      G
 And I realize just how beautiful You are
.        Fmaj7
 And how great Your affections are for me

[P]

.C                   Am7
 Oh, how he loves us so
.           G
 Oh, how he loves us
.                Fmaj7
 How he loves us so

.C Am7 G Fmaj7 (2x)

.       C
 Yea he loves us
.          Am7
 Oh how he loves us
.          G
 Oh how he loves us
.          Fmaj7
 Oh how he loves

[V2]
.   C
 So we are his portion and he is our prize
.Am7
 Drawn to redemption by the grace in his eyes
.   G                           Fmaj7
 If grace is an ocean we're all sinking
.   C
 So heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss
.       Am7
 And my heart turns violently inside of my chest
.  G
 I don't have time to maintain these regrets
.       Fmaj7
 when I think about the way...
