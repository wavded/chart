.B                                   E
  Into marvelous light I'm running
.                             G#m
 Out of darkness out of shame
.                 F#
 By the cross you are the truth
.    E
 You are the life You are the way

[V1]
.B                       E
  I once was fatherless, a stranger with no hope
.B                         E
  Your kindness wakened me, wakened me from my sleep
.B                            E
  Your love it beckons deeply, a call to come and die
.B                            E
  By grace now I will come and take this life, take your life

[P]
.G#m       F#             E
  Sin has lost its power, death has lost its sting
.G#m        F#                E
  From the grave you've risen victoriously.

.B                             E
  My dead heart now is beating, my deepest stains now clean
.B                              E
  Your breath fills up my lungs, now I'm free, now I'm free

 Lift my hands and spin around
.E
 See the light that I have found
.G#m           F#          E
  Oh the marvelous light,  marvelous light
