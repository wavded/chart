.B   F#sus   G#m   E

[V1]
.               B                    F#sus
 To the cross I look, to the cross I cling
.                       G#m
 Of it’s suffering I do drink
.                  E
 Of it’s work I do sing
.                B                     F#sus
 For on it my Savior, both bruised and crushed
.                   G#m              E
 Showed that God is love and God is just

[C]
.B
  At the cross You beckon me
.G#m
  You draw me gently to my knees and I am
.F#sus
  Lost for words, so lost in love, I’m 
.E
  Sweetly broken, wholly surrendered

[Intro]

[V2]
.                 B                F#sus
 What a priceless gift, undeserved life
.            G#m                       E
 Have I been given through Christ crucified
.                     B                    F#sus
 You called me out of death, You call into life
.                     G#m
 And I was under Your wrath,
.                               E
 now through the cross I'm reconciled

[C 2x]

[B]
.C#m                              E
  In awe of the cross I must confess
.C#m
  How wondrous Your redeeming love 
.         E                     F#sus
  And how great is Your faithfulness

[C 2x]
