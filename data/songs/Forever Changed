 I have built with my hands
.        C
 All the walls that hold me in
.         Em                     C
 I have wandered my way in the desert
.         Em
 I have struggled against
.          C
 All the blessings You have sent
.         Em                    C
 And I'm back to the place of surrender

 Lord, You meet me here

 In my darkest hour

 And You stir my heart

 With Your love

 Forever I am Yours my Savior

 Forever my hope is Christ

[V2]
 Tears are sweet as they fall
 Mercy rushes through my soul
 Bowing low as You wash me with healing
 Lord, You’ve sealed me with grace
 Life eternally sustained
 By the hope in my soul, You’re revealing

[B]

 The power of sin has broken

 I have been set free

 For I have died and Jesus
.     D
 Is alive in me
