 I have built with my hands
.        C
 All the walls that hold me in
.         Em                     C
 I have wandered my way in the desert
.         Em
 I have struggled against
.          C
 All the blessings You have sent
.         Em                    C
 And I'm back to the place of surrender

[P]

 Lord, You meet me here
.        D
 In my darkest hour
.          C        G/B
 And You stir my heart
.           D
 With Your love

[C]
.  C   G/B      D         Em
 Forever I am changed by mercy
.   C        G/B      Dsus D
 Forever my heart is alive
.   C  G/B      D        Em
 Forever I am Yours my Savior
.  C         D
 Forever my hope is Christ

[V2]
 Tears are sweet as they fall
 Mercy rushes through my soul
 Bowing low as You wash me with healing
 Lord, You’ve sealed me with grace
 Life eternally sustained
 By the hope in my soul, You’re revealing

[B]
.     C (Am)
 The power of sin has broken
.        D (G/B)
 I have been set free
.       C
 For I have died and Jesus
.     D
 Is alive in me

[V3]
 God please take from my hands
 My control and my demands
 As You write in the gifts of my story
 I take hold what You give
 In Your blessing will I live
 In Your peace, in Your grace, in Your glory
