 Draw me close to you
.E            A
 Never let me go
.E            D
 I lay it all down again
.F#m                    D
 To hear you say that I'm your friend
.A             D
 You are my desire
.E                A
 No one else will do
.E                        D
 Cause nothing else could take your place
.F#m                     D
 To feel the warmth of Your embrace
.A                D        E                 A    E
 Help me find the way,     bring me back to you

 You're all I've ever needed

 You're all I want
.D            E       A
 Help me know you are near
