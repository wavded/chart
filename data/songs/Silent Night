[V2]
 Silent night, holy night
 Shepherds quake at the sight,
 Glories stream from heaven afar,
 Heavenly hosts sing Alleleulia
 Christ the Saviour is born!
 Christ the saviour is born.

[V3]
 Silent night, holy night
 Son of God, love's pure light
 Radiant beams from Thy holy face
 with the dawn of redeeming grace,
 Jesus Lord at thy birth,
 Jesus Lord at thy birth.
