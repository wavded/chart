[Intro]
.Am - C/E - F

[V1]
.Am
 I can hear you
.C/E                F
 You're calling my name
.     F        G          Am
 The ocean between us erased

.Am
 And salvation
.C/E              F
 Pours down like rain
.F            G                [ F - Am - G (2x) ]
 Flooding my walls 'till I break

[C]
.F           G       Am
   I give my life to You
.    G/B  C
 My heart to You

 You're all I need
.          Am      F
 Come and make me new

[V2]
 I abandon
 The weight of my sin
 The weight of my loss and my pain
 Relief swells
 Like air in my lungs
 And freedom releases my shame

[B]
.F   G   Am           G/B C
   Jesus Christ, take our lives,
.    G            Am    F
 We won't waste another day
.  G   Am    G/B    C
 Holy God, fill our hearts,
.    G             Am   F
 We won't ever be the same
