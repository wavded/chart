[Sweetly Broken]
.B
  At the cross You beckon me
.G#m
  You draw me gently to my knees and I am
.F#sus
  Lost for words, so lost in love, Iâ€™m 
.E
  Sweetly broken, wholly surrendered

[Greater]
.E                F#sus          G#m
  There is no one higher, no one greater
.        A#m      B
  No one like our God
.E                F#sus            G#m
  There none more able, Christ our Savior
.            A#m   B
  Great and glorious

[Stand]
.E        B          F#sus         G#m
  So I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned
.E    B         F#sus    G#m
  In awe of the One who gave it all
.E        B          F#sus         G#m
  So I'll stand, my soul Lord to You surrendered
.E       B    F#sus    G#m
  All I am is Yours
