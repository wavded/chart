.D2                  Am7
  Clothed in rainbows, of living color.
.C2                               G
  Flashes of lightening, rolls of thunder.

  Blessing and honor, strength and

  To You, the only wise King.

.D2                  Am7
  Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder,
.C2                      G
  At the mention of Your Name.
.D2
  Jesus, Your Name is power,
.Am7
  breath and living water.
.C2                   G
  Such a marvelous mystery.
